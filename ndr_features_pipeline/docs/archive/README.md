# Documentation Archive

This area stores non-canonical historical documentation:

- `migration_notes/`: integration/additions notes from earlier implementation phases.
- `debug_records/`: bug-fix and implementation tracking records.
- `validation_logs/`: one-off operational validation/test logs.

Use canonical docs under `docs/architecture/` and `docs/feature_builders/` for current behavior.
